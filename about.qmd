title: "About Me"
---

Hello there! I am currently a graduate student in The University of Texas at Dallas' Applied Cognition & Neuroscience Program, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. With a background in psychology, I have always been interested in using my knowledge to support those in need. When I first learned about user experience (UX), I immediately fell in love with the field's multidisciplinary nature and evidence-based process.

I am passionate about creating digital services that are valuable and accessible to diverse user bases. I am a continuous learner and am excited to keep developing my skills through new opportunities in the future!

When I'm not working or studying, you can find me experimenting with songs on my keyboard, volunteering with friends, or exploring new worlds through literature.
