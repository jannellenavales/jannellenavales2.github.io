Welcome to my website! I'm a curious and creative problem solver that seeks to empower people through research and design.

My website is currently a work in progress - I'm currently working on formatting my projects so that they can be accessed individually. In the meantime, you can view my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZujT78aSYE2L2ZATTNqgXtU1iChc604H/view?usp=sharing) and [portfolio](https://bit.ly/44LwuU3).

**Note:** Professors, any class assignments will be published in the Assignments section!
